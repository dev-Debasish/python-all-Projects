# 🐍 Python Projects Collection  

Welcome to my Python practice repository!  
This repo is a collection of small to medium projects, exercises, and practice scripts that I’ve created while learning Python.  
It covers a wide range of concepts — from loops and patterns to mini-projects like games, automation, and personal finance trackers.
